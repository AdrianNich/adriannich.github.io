        <h1>The Story Of Adrian</h1>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">The Strengths and How They're Going to Help:</h3>
        <p>Words that describe me are passionate, engaging and dedicated. I'm someone who loves to get involved with meaningful causes, am fun to be around and 
            always happy to put in the time to achieve a goal. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>My dedication and hard work ethic, ensure I get through presented challenges as far as I possibly can.<br><br></li>
            <li>My passion helps in situations where creative ideas are required to progress a project. I often find when there is passion involved problem solving comes a lot easier.<br><br></li>
            <li>I also think my need for equity will help ensure that projects don’t just meet the needs of a particular group but have accessibility for people from all walks of life. <br><br></li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">The Areas for Development:</h3>
        <p>Like all of us, I have things I'd like to be much better at. They are things that come up in hard times which I still haven't mastered and were mentioned by people 
            who know me when researching for this post. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vulnerability<br>This is by far the top one for me and stems from struggling to ask for or admit I need help with a problem. This often sees me working far harder than I need to to achieve a goal. I want to become more comfortable with things which aren’t my strengths, and things which I’m struggling with, which would allow me to be more comfortable asking for help when I need to. I think Dev Academy and coding in general is going to be an excellent space to work on this. </li>
            <br><li>Organisation<br> This is one that I was nearly not going to add due to the work I have done on this area already. Not in becoming more organised but in accepting it as part of who I am and how I operate. I was always the kid with the messiest bedroom, the messy desk in the office etc but I always found it bothered other people a whole lot and bothered myself either very little or not at all. I am very much a beauty in chaos type of person, so where others see mess I more often see things in progress. 
            <br>Better organisation skills would help with planning, my modus operandi so far is to prioritise tasks so I manage my time more around what needs doing now, or next and smashing that out, and often getting things looking nice is quite far down the priority list. The main appeal for being better organised is in that it would/could help when working of teams of more organised people to function easier.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">The values:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Empathy<br> This has grown exponentially since becoming a father and noticing how I parent is very different to my own upbringing, and the one word that describes the overall difference is the presence of empathy. This has very much in turn altered my overall outlook on the world and how I deal with people.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Equity <br>This one leads on from empathy. Having more appreciation for where people are at and their own challenges, means they can find some challenges far more difficult than their peers from a different background. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Hardworking <br> I love a challenge, I love getting stuck in to new things and making things happen so am often someone who puts in long hours and big effort to defeat the challenge at hand.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Passionate <br> This leads on from the hardworking value, as to maintain a good work ethic I need to believe in what I’m working on, so when I adopt an idea, a challenge or start a project I go in boots and all. I’m not a big talker so my passion comes out through researching extensively, creating, brainstorming and producing rather than talking at length on the things I’m passionate about.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="text-align:left">The Evidence:</h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Research for this post involved conversing with people who know me well, sharing my thoughts on my strengths and challenges 
            and getting their feedback which assisted in compiling the content above. 
            <br><br> While doing this an episode of my life came to mind which I would like to share as it shares a situation where my values came in to question and how 
            I navigated through that challenge. <br> <br>
            In 2012, I purchased a run down espresso bar on a side street off Queen Street in Auckland CBD. It was a skinny dark little shop, which had had several different 
            cafes operate unsuccessfully from it over the years, a fact which was pointed out to me on several occasions by passers by. I spent several months doing 
            many long days transforming it from an outdated setup to a more modern fitout while running the café at the same time. Once having got the fitout how I wanted, and the coffee
            to a high standard, word started to get around about us, it grew from the initial coffee count of 30 cups a day when I bought it to 250 cups a day.<br><br>
            While doing that I also ran a barista training business helping people to get into the hospitality industry. <br><br>
            After a couple of years of running the espresso bar I implemented a gift economy model of pricing, so instead of the standard set price for a cup of coffee 
            and food, customers could choose how much they pay for what they bought. This took a lot of courage, and belief in myself to make it work. It took some time
             to help customers and staff feel comfortable with the model but it allowed for there to be more equity amongst the varied regular customers. The generous 
             ones with a higher income paid more and the students and people who were struggling could still enjoy an awesome coffee without breaking the bank. <br><br>
            In some ways it was a really hard decision to go ahead and change it up to a gift economy, there was a lot of fear around being ripped off, would people be 
            ethical in deciding how much to pay or would they see the opportunity for free coffee as too tempting to resist? Also, there weren’t any other examples I 
            knew of the model working in Auckland at the time, so I didn’t have anything to compare it with locally. In other ways it was really easy, I read up about 
            places overseas doing similar things and how they’d made it work, but really it was the feeling that it was the right thing to do which pushed the courage 
            button in me to make it happen. <br><br>Having run the espresso bar for a couple of years already, and being part of other businesses, I knew that capitalism wasn’t
             working for most people, and if I knew of a potentially better way of operating that aligned far more with the world I wanted to be a part of, and didn’t 
             take that up, it would have gone against my ethics. <br><br>
            Fortunately for me, I was able to run the business under the gift economy model and have it survive. My belief that overall people are good, but also that 
            people deserve awesome coffee in their life even if they can’t afford it paid off as people were very generous and happy to contribute to the costs of other
            people getting their coffee fix (It was also fascinating how many customers had NO IDEA how much they were meant to pay for a cup of coffee, they were so
            used to swiping their card and putting in their pin without even looking at the amount).
            <br><br> It was definitely challenging, the first month was an emotional
            rollercoaster as we waited to see if it was going to work or not, one customer would pay $10 for a flat white, the next would buy 4 flat whites and only
            pay $2. But overall we actually ended up on the same turnover as what we were on before the change and could sustain the business up until the time I 
            sold it a couple of years later.

        <h3 style="text-align:left">The Influence of Culture on Values and Identity:</h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify">The effects of growing up in a culture where winning was everything, the need to fit in and be “normal” to be accepted has undergone a lot of introspection in the last 15 years for me. 
            <br><br>There were definitely good things which have remained from it; being respectful; being honest and committing to getting the work done were all part 
            of the culture that I grew up with. However, there has been a lot of outdated ideas which were prolific which have not served our culture well; the systemic
             racism, homophobia, binary gender ideals have come in to a lot questioning over recent years and our culture has evolved to being far more tolerant in a lot
              of those areas, while there’s still a lot more work to be done, when I think back to work places even 10 years ago and the language used then would not be
               acceptable now. 
               <br><br>Witnessing that evolution and questioning myself on many cultural norms have helped me become more aware of things that we grow up accepting as 
               normal but need to change when we become aware of how they are not helping us. That is a long path, and has carried on in many areas of my life, as
                mentioned with capitalism above, along with re evaluating my personal worth to the world and how culturally it is so interlocked with money. 
                From looking at the world through those eyes I see that it affects all aspects of life, the jobs we choose, the way we bring up our tamariki,
                our relationships. Being aware of this has meant constant re evaluation of my values and my identity in general and has been the leading cause in things
                 like bringing up my kids in an unschooled environment, and working with community groups instead of profit driven organisations.<br><br>

            I align a lot with the work and thoughts of Charles Eisenstein. I have always had a struggle with the narrative of modern life that we are more or less products in a capitalist world and our worth is mostly based on our ability to earn an income. I am someone who commits fully to the task at hand but for that commitment to be maintained it needs to have a much deeper purpose than to create revenue. 
            One of Charles’ quotes that I most align with is:
             <br><br><em>“When everything is subject to money, then the scarcity of money makes everything scarce, including the basis of human life and happiness. Such is the life of the slave—one whose actions are compelled by threat to survival. Perhaps the deepest indication of our slavery is the monetization of time.” 
           </em><br><br> ― Charles Eisenstein, Sacred Economics: Money, Gift, and Society in the Age of Transition
