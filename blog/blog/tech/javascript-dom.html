        <h2>Javascript Fundamentals</h2>
        <h3>Javascript and it's relationship to HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>If HTML and CSS were middle management, Javascript is the CEO. HTML and CSS work together and make sure the storefront is operating 
          as per the Boards directive but Javascript has the overriding say as to what HTML and CSS do. 
          Javascript can intervene directly with middle management's operations, it also has the power to introduce more customer interaction,
          it's head and heels above HTML and CSS in that regard. It can request information from them and use that information to run other 
          operations and it can run those operations as many times as it needs to meet the customers needs. 
        </p>
        <h3>Control Flow and Loops Example Process</h3>
        <p>I'm going to use the example of mowing the lawns, in the control flow part we run the mower down one strip of lawn from the start to
          the end, in the loop we say we need to move the lawnmower across one width of the mower and repeat the process of completing the line of lawnmower
          and moving one lawnmower width across until we've reached the total width of the lawn
        </p>
        <h3>What is the DOM and how can we interact with it?</h3>
        <p>The DOM is an interface that allows us to have a direct view of what the different aspects of the websites code is doing
          It also allows us to test if the code we are running is doing what we expected it to be doing through outputting results of the code to the Console.
        </p>
        <!-- Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects. -->
        <h3>The difference between accessing data from Arrays and Objects</h3>
        <p>The difference between the two is Arrays are lists, organised by their index position. For example shoppingList = ["chocolate", "bread", "milk", "cheese"]
          would hold "chocolate" at index position 0, "bread" at position 1, "milk" at positon 2 and so on.
          To access the individual items from the index we access it through the name of the array followed by the index position in square brackets.
           For example to access cheese we would write shoppingList[3].<br>
           Objects on the other hand are unordered lists, of which the list items can each hold a corresponding value. Each item and it's value
           being assigned to a key. For example if the shopping list was an object it could include the item and also the quantity of each that we require:<br><br>
           shoppingList = {<br>
              chocolate: 7,<br>
              bread: 2,<br>
              milk: 2,<br>
              cheese: 1<br>
           }<br>
          <br>
          To access an item and it's corresponding value in an object we need to do so by using a dot notation.
          For example to return the amount of chocolate we would need we would write: shoppingList.chocolate
          <h3>Functions and why they're useful</h3>
          <p>A function is a segment of coding which can be called to run simply by calling said function. <br>
          They are extremely useful if situations when we need to run that same segment of coding several times
          in different areas of the project, as it removes the need to write out that segment of code each
          time it is needed.</p>
