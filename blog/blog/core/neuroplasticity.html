          <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
          <h3>Understanding Neuroplasticity</h3>
          <p>Understanding Neuroplasticity benefits people as it removes the glass ceiling which is preventing them from reaching goals they feel are beyond their skillset or ability.</p>
          <h3>Using Neuroplasticity Principles for Good</h3>
          <p>One might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity, by checking in on where our mindset is when struggling on a challenge. This will help ensure learning pathways are open and receptive to learning rather than blocking through lack of belief in ability.</p>
          <h3>Increasing Neuroplasticity</h3>
          <p>To increase neuroplasticity requires an understanding of how our brains learn most effectively. <br>
            <a href="https://accelerate.uofuhealth.utah.edu/resilience/neuroplasticity-how-to-use-your-brain-s-malleability-to-improve-your-well-being">https://accelerate.uofuhealth.utah.edu/resilience/neuroplasticity-how-to-use-your-brain-s-malleability-to-improve-your-well-being</a><br>
            Megan Call from the link above describes the following components as being of importance to increasing neuroplasticity:
            <ul>
                <li>Having the new topic be challenging	and novel.</li>
                <li>Have a reason for learning good enough to convince your brain that you’re committed and this is important</li>
                <li>Have a plan, break the elephant down into bite size chunks so it’s easier to see the path to where you want to be </li>
                <li>Short, intense repetition.. repeating until you get bored is not going to help you learn, it’s far better to have short intense practice sessions of the skill you’re currently trying to master</li>
                <li>Be patient, and understanding that learning new skills is difficult, so go easy on yourself.
                    Lot’s of positive self talk around the effort being put in and reassurance that the effort will pay off if you keep at it.</li>
            </ul> 
            
            <h3>Growth Mindset, what it is and why it's important</h3>
            <p>Your mindset plays a huge part in your ability to learn new things, succeed in relationships, complete challenges and get the best out of life. Your mindset determines the attitude you go in to a situation with.<br>
                The fixed mindset tells you that you’re either good at something or you’re not, that you have very limited capacity to improve or learn new skills. The growth mindset tells you that failure is not the end of the road, that challenges are part of the journey, that you have the ability to continue learning and getting better indefinitely.  </p>
            <p>The thing that surprised me the most was the effect of seeing “failure” as a skill that you have yet to master rather than as proof that you’re not good at something, and how making that slight modification to your mindset can have vast ramifications on your achievements.

               I enjoyed this article <a href= https://www.understood.org/articles/en/growth-mindset >https://www.understood.org/articles/en/growth-mindset</a> as it also includes ideas on improving your mindset as well as covered other topics that are equally helpful in self development.

            <h3>Learning plan strategies and the Growth Mindset</h3>   
            <p>I will be using the growth mindset a lot in times when I’m struggling, I noticed in Sprint 3 there was definite self doubt starting to creep in when I was stuck on a problem. Reminding myself to check in on the mindset would help a lot in those instances.
