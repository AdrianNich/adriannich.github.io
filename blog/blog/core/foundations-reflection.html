          <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li> That I struggle to ask for help more than I thought I did</li><br>
            <li> That most other people struggle with things as much as I do</li><br>
            <li> Getting out of your comfort zone in core learning is good for your humility</li><br>
            </ul>
          <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
          <p>Values are our guide, they dictate what we accept in how we approach our learning, are we insistent on working it out ourselves, no matter how long it takes, or do we jump to looking at the solutions too quickly? They often need to be evaluated and revised to allow us to keep on the path we want/need to be going.</p>
          <p> Empathy for others is what helps people feel included, valid and accepted. In a learning course like this we have a wide range of skill level, from complete newbie to computer science degree graduate, the need for empathy is high as newbies work their way through the initial learning curve and the whizzes have to wait for bootcamp to be challenged (assumption). It’s been heart warming to watch the level of engagement between the different skill levels, the assistance and patience shown to people who are in the deep end. </p>
          <p>Self awareness is fascinating to people watch for.. on one end of the scale there are those of us who have no self awareness and rub people up the wrong way with out any realisation they are doing so, on the other end there are people who are so aware their words and actions may impact people that they don’t speak up enough. Finding the balance is difficult, as we only have the one camera angle. In learning environments like this, we can experience something as simple as seeking clarification of what someone meant, coming across as confrontational due to a lack of awareness in the wording used, and we can see people being aware they need to push themselves to ask the questions despite feeling uncomfortable.</p>
            
          <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
          <p>How it interests others as much as it does myself.</p>
          <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the Core Learning?</h3>
          <p>Posting my stuff for the world to see.</p>
          <h3>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
          <p>Because relationships are everything! If we can improve our EQ we improve our relationships which makes working with others on difficult projects easier.</p> 
          <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
          <p>Def not a waste of time, I like how it’s become a weekly if not daily factor to check in on and work on. Any chance to improve ones self is good, especially if it's a requirement of the course as it's more likely to get one out of their comfort zone.</p>
