          <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
          <p>Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is the measure of ones ability to identify emotions in their self and others, and how they use 
            that knowledge in relationships. <br>
            The use of that knowledge can be witnessed in how one communicates, how they give and receive feedback and how they present and receive ideas.<br>
            The EQ of someone has a significant impact on how that person works in teams, how people interact with them and how others feel working with them.
            </p>
          <h3>How is it different from IQ?</h3>
          <p>It differs from IQ as it has a wider scope of influence. IQ relates to ones ability to problem solve and learn new things, which is really important in completing tasks, however, the EQ affects how useful that ability is in dealing with other people and even with themselves.
            <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
          <p>EQ is so important as it affects ones ability to relate to people, how they treat people and how they treat themselves which has a significant impact on what the person can achieve both individually and as part of a team.</p>
