          <h3>The Time I Got Stuck On A Simple Problem</h3>
          <p>I have many to choose from.<br> <br>
            The ones that I will probably laugh about when I stop doing it though are when there are challenges where I read the challenge, I understand it, I have a good idea of how to tackle it, to the point that I’m confident. 
            <br><br>I write it out, it looks good.. I run it, error!
            <br><br>I double check the code, looks fine. 
            <br><br>I rubber ducky it, no clues
            <br><br>The self doubt starts creeping in “This is a simple problem, it’s just asking me to return the result of this function”… RETURN!! Dammit, I console logged it again, instead of returning!
            <br><br>Fortunately, the last one took far longer than it should have to realise, that I’ve noticed it’s the first thing I look for when reading through a new challenge and the first thing I check when the expected result doesn’t happen.

          <h3>Problem Solving Techniques</h3>  
          <ul>
                <li><b>Pseudocode</b><br>
                  I need to do this more as I found myself jumping in to the trying something, and I’m finding I often get stuck afterwards as I haven’t comprehended the challenge adequately. Pseudocoding would most likely assist in checking I have steps that match the challenge at hand.
                  <br></li>
                <li><b>Trying Something</b> </br>
                  This is probably my most frequently used technique. I just want to get into it and try something to see if I’m on the right path or not. 
                  <br></li>
                <li><b>Rubber Ducky Method</b><br>
                  I have used this a lot over the past 2 weeks.. so much pacing, talking to myself.. I often don’t realise I’m doing it until one of my kids says “what??” as I’ve randomly started explaining something aloud, not quite time for the straight jacket but prob not far off.
                  </li>
                <li><b>Reading Error Messages</b><br>I use these as queues as to where I’m tripping up and this is often followed by Googling to get a better grasp.</li>
                <li><b>Console.logging</b><br>Is another one I use extensively. often after a “damn, I’m sure that’s doing what I meant it to do… what is it actually doing?” type moment. Console.log shows me if it is doing as expected or not.</li>
                <li><b>Googling</b><br>Is lifesaving, and also frustrating.. it just often leads you in the right direction as sends you down a rabbit hole. I use this a lot often after using the ‘try something’ method.</li>
                <li><b>Asking Your Peers For Help</b><br>Is really helpful, but not something I feel comfortable with at this point. I know as we move through this will be needed more and more to stay on track.</li>
                <li><b>Asking Coaches For Help</b><br>As above but I’m getting better at it, accepting I’m learning something new from scratch, and getting comfortable with not being good at it straight away and needing help to work things out.</li>
                <li><b>Improving Your Process With Reflection</b><br>Is something I practice a lot in every day life. Repetition, reflecting, and practicing appreciating the challenge of the journey to help get in a good headspace for the next challenge has been a process I’ve found myself using a lot, especially at the end of a challenging day.</li>
              </ul>
