          <h1>What's the plan, Stan?? </h1>
          <h3>What do we want?</h3>
          <p>To find meaningful, project based work in web development</p>
          <h3>How are we gonna get it?</h3>
          <p>By studying my ass off to overcome my current lack of dev knowledge, and improving my time keeping and communications skills when under the pressure;
              by using my strengths in connecting with a wide range of personality types, 
              my workhorse work ethic and my out of the box problem solving skills to master the know how to code efficiently in a team environment.</p>
          <h3>How's that going to look in practice?</h3>
          <p>Planning is the key to managing my available time. With my childcare agreement I have every 2nd week without children, so have full days available for study. The other weeks,
              when I have my children takes a lot more scheduling but so far it has been working that I get started at 9am after school drop offs. I then have 3 x 50 minute 
              blocks to study, each one followed by a 10 minute breather.<br> From midday I have a 45 minute break for some kai and a breather outside, followed by 2 more 50/10 sessions 
              before collecting school kids, and getting them set up for the arvo, enabling me to do a 90 minute study session before stopping for dinner and kid sorting. My evening study session  
              runs from 7.30pm to 9.30pm</p>
            <p>With the above schedule I am able to break down sprint tasks for the week into the daily study slots, and tackle the tasks in managable time periods.</p>
            <h3>What about when the going get's tough?</h3>
            <p>When things get tough, I will evaluate my remaining tasks and the time slots available to complete them to see if I am able to keep to the agreed schedule or if I'm going to need some help to get through 
               the current obstacle to keep things on track. 
               When the need for help arises I will raise the problem with the affected parties (cohort partners, facilitator etc), and negotiate a revised plan to get to the best
               outcome possible for the situation.</p>
            <h3>What do you need from the help?</h3>
            <p>From the facilitators I need up front feedback, they will no doubt see things a lot clearer on the outside than I do from being in the middle of projects. If they see
                there's areas I'm needing to sort out I want to hear about it.<br> Also, if I'm stuck hard in a problem some guidance around where to look for solutions would be ace but I appreciate
                a big part of this process is finding where to find solutions on my own, so maybe if there's scope to act as a knowledgable listening post could be just what I need to get things organised mentally.
            </p>
            <h3>The Elevator Pitch Summary</h3>
            <p>The goal is to kick arse in this course to allow me to secure work as a web developer on projects with real meaning.<br>
            This is going to be achieved through utilising my people skills to work as efficiently as possible with cohort colleagues, by improving my organisational and time keeping skills
            throughout the course. By continuously evaluating my situation and speaking up when I'm in a tunnel and needing to talk through the situation to see the light at the end.</p>
